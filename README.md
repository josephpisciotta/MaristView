README
---------------------------

This project is for use at Marist College to give a viewport into the physical congestion of events and buildings. (ie. - McCann gym, dining hall).

Currently the project does not have access to the "real" CWID system so we will simulate it and the resulting card swipes using a system how "ideally" the real CWID would be implemented.
